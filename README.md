# 俊樹のSurf

> This repository mostly contains some backups of my browser/browser extension metadata such as third-party loaded scripts/styles; yet with bookmarks and other RSS feeds for improving internet surfing experience via such subtle assisting toolkit.

The list displayed as follows are the explanations of the usages/content of each folder which are the current third party toolkit I in personnel use at the moment.

- **bookmarks**: As indicated in the folder name, a complete set of my self collected bookmarks over past years. Within the folder two file named with `toshiki-bookmark.html` and `toshiki-bookmarklet.html` corresponds to the actual bookmark set, the other one contains bookmarklets which are bookmarks stored in a web browser that contains JavaScript commands that add new features to the browser. (refer more about bookmarklet [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet))

- **feeds**: Indicated in the name of the folder, the RSS feeds I subscribed over the past year viewed via extension rss [feeder](https://feeder.co). (To be honest I just store them for a weird collectomania possession but rarely view, totally based off my own mood)

- **scripts**: Some scripts that is capable of been injected to webpages via a third party userscript manager such as [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) I use at current. These scripts undeniably boost up my viewing experiences and productivity.

- **styles**: Custom css/scss styles load via a third party extension such as stylus, for highly customizing oldish dull-looking webpages into a more modern styled, user-friendly UI.
